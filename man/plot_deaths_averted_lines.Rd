\title{Plot cumulative deaths averted across models and runs}
\usage{
plot_deaths_averted_lines(model_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_data}{A data frame containing model simulation output with the
following required columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{date} — time variable (Date or numeric).
\item \verb{no PSS drug_deaths} — number of deaths in the counterfactual
scenario with no PSS intervention.
\item \verb{PSS drug_deaths} — number of deaths in the PSS intervention scenario.
\item \code{model} — model identifier (factor or character).
\item \code{run} — simulation run identifier (numeric or character).
}}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object showing cumulative deaths averted over time,
stratified by model with multiple simulation runs shown as faint lines.
}
\description{
This function takes simulated model output and produces a line plot of
cumulative deaths averted over time. Deaths averted are calculated as the
difference between the number of drug-related deaths under a
counterfactual scenario with no PSS and the number of deaths under the
PSS intervention. The results are grouped by model and simulation run,
and cumulative sums are plotted as semi-transparent lines to visualize
uncertainty across runs.
