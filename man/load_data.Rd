\title{Load and Combine BCROM and OTEM Model Output Data}
\usage{
load_data(round = "one")
}
\arguments{
\item{round}{character, either "one" or "two"}
}
\value{
A tibble containing the combined data from the BCROM and OTEM models, with
an added \code{model} column and a parsed \code{date} column.
}
\description{
This function reads in CSV files containing output from the BCROM and OTEM models,
processes and combines the data into a single tibble. It adds a \code{model} column
to distinguish the data sources and constructs a \code{date} column from the \code{year} and
\code{month} columns.
}
\details{
The function expects the files \code{BCROM_comparison_outputs.csv} and
\code{OTEM_comparison_outputs.csv} to be located in \verb{data/raw/} relative to the project root,
as determined by the \code{here} package.

The following transformations are applied:
\itemize{
\item The \code{...1} column is removed from the BCROM dataset if present.
\item A \code{model} column is added with values \code{"bcrom"} or \code{"otem"}.
\item A \code{date} column is constructed by combining \code{year} and \code{month} with a dummy day \code{"01"}.
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
data <- load_data()
head(data)
}
